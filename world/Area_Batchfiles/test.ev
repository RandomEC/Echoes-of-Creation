desc r6602 = A compact room with soft colored walls is the gathering place for story times.  A sturdy rocker sits undisturbed in the center while a few bean bags have been tossed around it.  A cushioned bench sits directly in front of the rocker and a bookshelf, made of tree branches, overflowing with various children's books is behind.  The smell of food floats gently in the air from the east.  The wails of an angry child come from the west while laughter filters in from the south.

desc r6601 = A simple building from the outside, this room begins to show the depth that hides within.  This is where parents may drop off or pick up their children.  A small mat has been placed on the boarded ground to avoid foot tracks from the path outside.  Several windows line the northern wall. Potted plants reside in each corner.  An easel stands just almost in the rooms center.  There is a sign above the doorway to the east and there is an exit to the south.
