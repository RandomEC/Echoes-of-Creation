Inspired by and dedicated for the fair lady Icaza. by Hatchet, 3/7/94 ', 'two': ' . Little Girl One day, I happened upon a little girl, Sitting on the stump of a tree. She was dressed in blue, head full of curls, And she was smiling at me! "Hello, dear old man," she says to me. "I\'m going to Wonderland! If you would like to come join me, Please, take hold of my hand!" I had barely touched her hand, When she ran off at a tear, Pulling me to a far away land That only she knew where. I watched this girl run like the fire, She must be under twenty. But she didn\'t slow, she didn\'t tire, While I hobbled behind, panting aplenty. Suddenly, we both started flying, With the Earth shrinking behind. I thought I must be dying, Or just losing my mind! "Where are we going, what is your name?", I yelled to the little girl. But nothing will distract this dame, As through a hole we hurl. I was suddenly filled with white light. Wondering what would next happen. But then I was no longer afright, As I saw what must be Heaven! Tranquil plains blossomed before my eyes As we came down to land. I looked around, from green grass to blue skies. This must be Wonderland! We finally stopped, our destination here, As we came upon a grand plaza. She leaned over, whispered to my ear, "I am Goddess Icaza." Inspired by and dedicated to the fair lady Icaza. 3/7/94 by Hatchet ', 'three': ' . Untitled I read a poem to my love, One that comes to me unbidden. It is a simple poem, written by simple me, but writing such a poem makes me laugh, and it makes her cry And I know that at that very moment, we are both experiencing the same emotion, Love. Inspired by and dedicated to the fair lady Icaza by Hatchet 3/14/94 ', 'four': " . Untitled Leaves swirling around us, Raindrops in our hair. Locked within one another's embrace, Lost in our own world. We kiss softly, longingly, Secure within our own warmth. People scurry around us, Oblivious to us, we oblivious to them. Inspired by and dedicated to the fair lady Icaza by Hatchet 4/4/94 ", 'five': ' . Proposal I am enchanted by you. So easily you have captured my heart. And so happy I am when I think of you, My life I wish you to be a part. I am in love with you, After only knowing you for time so short. It is your love that I now woo, You hand I now quietly court. I am lonely without you, You are so vital to my life. So I now humbly beg of you, Susan, please be my wife. by Hatchet, 9/1/93, recited to Icaza on 9/9/1994 '}
