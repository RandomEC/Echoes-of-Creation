A Ring of Mushrooms~
In this little field, the grass and weeds grow tall.  Yet oddly, a small
circular patch grows low, bordered by a ring of purple mushrooms.  Inside
that circle, the grass, greener than the surrounding field, huddles close to
the ground.

Entrance Hall~
You are in a cramped, low ceiling tunnel. Roots dangle overhead and caress 
you. There are tiny doors to the north, south and west, which you think you 
could crawl your way into. A ladder fashioned of woven roots leads up. You 
hear sounds of a raucous celebration to the east.

Puck's Room~
You are hunched over in Puck's room. You know this by the sign that says 
"Pucks stuff - keep your grubby hands off". There is a bed of forest leaves, 
some rude hollowed out shelves, a tiny table with a half full jack of ale, 
and a great pile of junk beneath the sign.

Little People's Bar and Grill~
You squeeze into the famous Little People's Bar and Grill! Conversation 
abruptly stops as you enter. Around you little people are drinking from 
beautifully crafted crystal glasses. The smoke is thick and buoys your 
spirits. Maybe you should stay a while and try the faerie wine? A low tunnel 
heads west, and you hear a thunderous racket coming from the east.

You are hunched over in a bowling alley! Little people are rolling round 
objects down grooved tracks at long white targets. The whole cave echoes in a 
dreadful crash each time they hit the targets! Oh you wish you had that glass 
of faerie wine. To the west is the Little People's Bar and grill.
