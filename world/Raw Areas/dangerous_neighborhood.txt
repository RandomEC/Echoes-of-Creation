Beginning of White Dragon Boulevard~
This section of town has been overrun by the Troll gang.  Even the
police stay out of here for fear of being brutalized.  This was once
a nice lower-middle class neighborhood, but know the gangs run the
streets.  All the shops and homes have been boarded up and abandoned.
An alleyway is to the west and the street continues east.  An overgrown lot is to the south.

Another Corner of Hector and Achilles streets~
Achilles street heads to the south and Hector runs east and west.
There is an entrance to "No Man's Land" to the north.  On the
southwest corner of this intersection, it looks like a building
was recently burned down.

Hector Street at Jeweler~
Once a bright spot in the town, it now looks like one of the
hardest hit by the violence.  The building could collapse at any
moment.  The street continues east and west.

Corner of Ajax and Hector~
There is a grand fountain to the east but the water doesn't
look good to drink.  Ajax street heads south and Hector
goes back west.  "No Man's Land" is to the north.

Hector Street~
The street is full of garbage here.  An odd building lies to the west,
but you don't seem to be able to find a way into it.  The street
runs north and south here.

Achilles Avenue~
The town bards sang of the victory parades that used to pass along this
route.  It was once a major way through the center of town.  The street
goes south to a bend and north to an intersection.

A Small, Ruined Chapel~
This was a small temple built to honor the minor gods and goddesses.
It is now desecrated by graffiti and vandalism.  Perhaps its worst
defilement is that it is the hangout of the Ogre gang.  There is a street to
the east through a rusty metal door.

First Intersection of Hector and Achilles~
There is a large statue here depicting a battle between two
great warriors.  You think it's odd that it has not been defiled,
but then you sense an aura protecting it.  Achilles runs east
and south, while Hector heads out to the north.

There is a large wrought-iron fence with spikes on top
which prevents you from entering the area.  The street

What Is Left of the Weapon Shop~
It doesn't even look like those punks gave the weaponsmith a
proper burial.  But what a going away present he seems to have
received!  Blood is splattered and dried all over the walls here.
It looks like a great deal of carnage happened here.  The way
out to the east leads out onto a street.

Khan Park~
Not really a "park" as you and I would think of it but
it seems queerly peaceful here in comparison to the rest of
the area.  There seems to be some kind of memorial to the
great Mongol warrior Khan being crudely constructed here.
There is a street to the east and another to the south.

is to the west but it has been crushed under its own weight.

been demolished.  An inn/pub is to the south.  The street bends

A Wide Alleyway~
The sides of the alleyway have been vandalized many times.
One patch of graffiti actually looks readable:
            This section has been designed for levels 5 through 10
            If you are above level 10 please don't expect much.
            If you are below level 5 enter at your own risk.
In another spot it says "now entering Ogre territory..."
A street lies to the east, and west, it seems to fade into a blur,
like some sort of magical pathway.

Alexander Road~
You see many gang members walking around looking for
fights to pick and things to break.  It seems as if all of the
other citizens have been run out of town.  All the former
homes are boarded up and uninhabitable.  The road continues
east and west.

The inn actually looks fairly functional despite its lack
of repair.  The boys come here to hoot it up and drink themselves
into oblivion sometimes.  It looks as if the beer is still on tap!!!
A hallway leads south and you spy a street through the doorway
to the north.
