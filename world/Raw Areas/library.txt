tell $n I think I know something of that.  Something about a runic tablet to unlock it.
tell $n You go get a stone tablet, and I'll read up on it.  I'm certain I can find this.  It sounds so familiar.
tell $n Oh, I think you can probably find a tablet easily enough.  One of the preeminent mages in the world is bound to have one, and I'm sure you can just ask for it.
tell $n Perhaps in Kaersblade or Camelot?  I don't know.  I don't really travel much, outside the Library.
tell $n Give me the tablet when you get it, and I'll make sure it's okay.

tell $n I did some research, and found that the runes you much write on the tablet must be special.  They need to be written in dragon's blood.
tell $n Not only that, but the quill must be a magic chimera feather, so that it can resist the acidity of the blood..
tell $n I can write them, but I have none of those things.  You have to go get them.
tell $n In the meantime, I shall practice the runes with ink, to be certain I don't get them wrong.

sense of amazement.)  It thrusts its front cover forward, then swings
all the pages and the back cover toward the front.  And it does this
very fast, and over and over again.

The "garbage monster" is a furious little dragon.

The garbage monster's story is a simple one.  It got Edith angry, and
found itself shrunk to its current size, and tossed in the trash.  Now
Edith uses it to incinerate the trash.

A dust bunny slouches in the corner, hissing and giggling.
~
This is a truly disgusting creature.  It's covered with dirt,
possibly the dirtiest thing you've ever seen.  It's drooling a long
strand of a greenish liquid.  All down its front is a dried-up
yellow-brown mess, that looks (and smells) like dried vomit.

all of her bunions.  Also, her foot odor is starting to really make

CHAPTER3~
The book goes on to speculate that perhaps the god Karnox could
be freed from the sword, if a strong enough magic were used.
However, it says, this action would be most unwise, considering its
vast power, and the fact that the vicious deity will likely be very
angry.  It goes on to mention that the legends of the Karnox say
that it has sworn to slay all who have ever held it in battle, and
then destroy the gods who trapped it in steel for an eternity.

CHAPTER2~
The great Black Blade, the book says, has created many legends, and been

has found its way into the hands of many great men, and changed the

the malevolent one, but his power still seeps into the world.

Within the Achaean Camp~
You are now deep inside the Achaean camp.  Moving through the camp all
around you are (big surprise) Achaeans.  In all directions are the tents
of some of the Achaean leaders.

Diomedes's Tent~
The prince of Argos has set all the furnishings in his tent far
at the back.  The resulting large open space in the front of the
tent is designed to make others uncomfortable.  It works.

Here, atop a small hill, littered with dead, are two of the greatest

To the south of you are Troy's walls, and in the middle is the Scaean

Within the Palace~
The entry hall to the palace of Troy is a large, empty, white hallway.
Echoes reverberate here, and you can hear everything you say sounding
again and again.  A large stairway rises from the middle of the hall,
to the top floor of the palace.

The Great Hall~
This hall looks much like the one downstairs, except that at the
north end of it is a gigantic hardwood door, on which is carved the
heron, the symbol of Troy's royal house.  Doors east and west lead to
the quarters of other high-ranking guests.

Troy's great palace never fails to impress.  The throne room's
golden pillars hold up it's great ceiling majestically.  The throne's

You're in the northeast corner of Edith's office, and the trash can

In a Mouse Hole~
The mouse hole is actually a pretty nice home.  The mouse has a rather
comfortable-looking easy chair, and the whole hole is comparable
to a rich man's den.  There are small rugs on the ground, and what
look like hunting trophies (insect heads) mounted on the walls.

In the Trash Can~
Eww, this is disgusting.  Where did all this stuff come from?  Who
throws this away?  You're hip-deep in coffee grounds, banana peels,
used chewing gum, shredded paper, and a myriad of other garbage.
As your foot sloshes in something, you look down, and suddenly feel an
urge to add to the vomit that you've just stepped in.
