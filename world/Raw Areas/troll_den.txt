#ROOMS
#8920
Waste Dump~
This room is filled with chewed bone shards and fragments, those that
haven't fallen into the pit below.  Something (or things) very big live
here.  The cave continues north and east.  You can actually distinguish two
different awful odors, one from the east and one, stronger, from below.

Troll's Larder~
This room has blood and grime all over the walls.  You see maggots and other
insects crawling up them.  The resident is definitely uncivilized.  Half-eaten
and rotting body parts scatter the floor, each having its own colony of flies,
worms, and maggots.

Troll's Living Room~
It takes a brave soul to wander this deep into a troll's lair, and this
brave soul's nose will regret every step.  There's no less dirt and grime on
the walls here, and the perpetual stink might actually be worse.

#8923
The Playpen~
The walls are covered with blood (and body parts!?!?).  Plastered on the far
wall you see what looks like a human arm.  A half-eaten body lies here with
its chest ripped out.  The predator seems disinterested in it.

#8924
Troll's Bedroom~
Obviously something REALLY big lives here.  The stench is quite unbearable.
There are piles and piles of rotten and half-eaten body parts of animals,
orcs, (and humans?) strewn across the floor.  There is a larger, more
prominent pile of rotten parts over in a corner.  It seems to have been
flattened by something.

#8926
In a Cave~
The cave is pretty dark, and this part feels kind of moist, due to river
water collecting in a puddle on the floor here.  The ground slopes up a
little as the cave leads south, which probably means it's drier in there.

are lots of broken, cracked, and shattered bones here.  Most of them are
picked clean of flesh...most of them.

In the Bone Pit~
This is the depths of the bone pit, and the bones are pretty broken up
down here.  A lot of them are jagged and pointed, and falling in here could
seriously injure someone.  There's a fair stench in here too, from the
rotting flesh left on some of the bones.

Cave~
There's a turn in the cave here, and it leads west and south.  There's a
good bit of slick and half-dried blood on the ground here, and a few little
pieces of flesh on sharp parts of the rock.  They must have torn off
something...
