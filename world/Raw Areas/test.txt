the dwarven youth~
A young dwarf plays with a toy axe.
~
This is a young but not totally harmless child.  He has short cropped
hair and dark brown eyes.  His mischievous nature comes out with the waving
of his toy axe.  He feels that this is his domain and no one shall infringe
upon it.

axe toy~
This axe is made out of black colored plastic.  It prolly would not be a
great weapon for fighting the larger creatures in the realms.

ring ice pink~
This ring holds some magic powers.  For as it feels as cold as ice when
you put it on, it will never melt.  It is a light colored pink and shines a
bit in the light.

#ROOMS

Daycare Foyer~
A simple building from the outside, this room begins to show the depth
that hides within.  This is where parents may drop off or pick up their
children.  A small mat has been placed on the boarded ground to avoid foot
tracks from the path outside.  Several windows line the northern wall. 
Potted plants reside in each corner.  An easel stands just almost in the
rooms center.  There is a sign above the doorway to the east and there is an
exit to the south.

Story Time~
A compact room with soft colored walls is the gathering place for story
times.  A sturdy rocker sits undisturbed in the center while a few bean bags
have been tossed around it.  A cushioned bench sits directly in front of the
rocker and a bookshelf, made of tree branches, overflowing with various
children's books is behind.  The smell of food floats gently in the air from
the east.  The wails of an angry child come from the west while laughter
filters in from the south.
