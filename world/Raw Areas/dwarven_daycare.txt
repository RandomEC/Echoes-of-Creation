the dwarven youth~
A young dwarf plays with a toy axe.
~
This is a young but not totally harmless child.  He has short cropped
hair and dark brown eyes.  His mischievous nature comes out with the waving
of his toy axe.  He feels that this is his domain and no one shall infringe
upon it.

a teddy bear~
A cute and fuzzy teddy bear stands here.
~
This is a tiny little bear.  It has white fuzzy fabric and a heart on
it's chest.  For some reason or another it seems alive.  Every so often it
wanders around the room and tries out all the furniture.  Perhaps looking
for the best place to rest when there are no children around.

The bug has found a home in the dim and dusty closet.  A slender black
body with six legs, it crawls along seemingly with no fear.  Two minuscule
feelers probe out in front of it's triangular head, surveying it's
surroundings.

a toy soldier~
A toy soldier stands guard here.
~
A prim and proper soldier is at his post.  A toy with life-like
appearance, it scans the area for possible target practice.  With any
movement, it's head will turn in hopes of finding new prey.  It's armor is
polished to a bright shine and it's gun has been well cleaned.  It stands
with an evil twinkle in it's eyes.

This old doll has seen better days.  It has been hugged and played with
so often that it is falling apart.  There is still a hint of life left in

Mimicking the dwarven guards of the kingdom, this boy has dressed up in a
guards uniform.  Through the helmet an angry scowl shows through.  He stands

watching over some sort of secret within the depths of the basement.

the spoiled brat~
A spoiled brat is crying here.
~
This little one is used to getting what he wants.  He is screaming and
kicking now because the nannies would not give him a lollipop.  He has been
sent down here as punishment and to be allowed to reflect upon his actions. 
Even now, with soiled clothes, a runny nose and watery eyes, he only cares
that he didn't get his treat.

The dwarven nanny is more round than tall.  Her hair is finely braided to
the back.  She occupies her time mainly with insuring all the daycare's
paperwork is in order.  The wrinkles in her forehead show the signs of heavy
thought.  She is proud of the work she does and has a distaste for those who
are not as orderly.

Daycare Foyer~
A simple building from the outside, this room begins to show the depth
that hides within.  This is where parents may drop off or pick up their
children.  A small mat has been placed on the boarded ground to avoid foot
tracks from the path outside.  Several windows line the northern wall. 
Potted plants reside in each corner.  An easel stands just almost in the
rooms center.  There is a sign above the doorway to the east and there is an
exit to the south.

Story Time~
A compact room with soft colored walls is the gathering place for story
times.  A sturdy rocker sits undisturbed in the center while a few bean bags
have been tossed around it.  A cushioned bench sits directly in front of the
rocker and a bookshelf, made of tree branches, overflowing with various
children's books is behind.  The smell of food floats gently in the air from
the east.  The wails of an angry child come from the west while laughter
filters in from the south.

The young tykes are mostly limited to play in this room.  Wooden crates
and cabinets, for storing the various toys, take up nearly all the wall
space.  A large rug, barely visible under the mass of dragged out toys,
hides the many scratches and dents from previous play sessions.  From
building blocks to dress-up dolls most of the children find something to
briefly entertain themselves.

Arts 'N Crafts~
For the more imaginative youngsters an arts and crafts center was made. 
All the decorations of this room have been left up to the children.  The
once white walls have been adorned with tiny painted shapes like circles,
squares and triangles and even some hand and foot prints.  One wall is
dedicated solely to finger paintings.  Two half-moon tables allow the young
artists to explore their creativity.  A counter runs along the wall for
storing of paints, paper, molding clay and other useful art tools.

Even with signs of tampering the wire fence stands strong.  This section
of the playground contains nothing but a giant sand box.  Toys have been
tossed all around, several buried over half-way in the sand.  Mounds have
been created in several places for use as a mountain or volcano.  Some
children have even created complex and detailed villages, while others have
created bog and swamp scenes.

A large wire fence surrounds the entire playground keep children from
wandering off.  There are two slides and a swing set in this area.  One
slide is a straight downward run while the other corkscrews several times. 
The swing is deteriorating and looks as if any amount of weight will cause
it to fall, but still has three seats in good condition.  The grass has
grown up around the slides but is totally worn away from the ladders and the
landings.  The swing has no grass around it at all.

the stagnant air.  Cobwebs and dirt block much of the view of the walls. 
Most of the children know this room as the entrance to the maze and they
stay away.  To the east the surroundings change but the light does not.

The pictures here old attempts at art by the children.  Among them are

depicting a slaughtered dwarven guard.

Snow White is the theme among these pictures.  There is a rather large
one with all the seven dwarves coming home from work and one of the wicked
stepmother disguised as an ugly old lady holding an apple.  The most
catching of all is a beautiful painting of Snow White herself.

The pictures of this room form a mural.  It depicts several dwarves
standing in awe before a huge fierce dragon.  The dragon taking up nearly
all three of the walls.  There is a small inscription towards the bottom
that reads, Shakes.

First Aid~
Nothing more than a niche, the first aid station is a busy place.  The
air almost takes on a sterile smell.  One wall is nothing but cabinets from
floor to ceiling.  Each door and compartment holds various bandages,
ointments and healing tools to handle most any accident.  On the other wall
there is a cot and a water station.  There is ample light from the several
lanterns hanging from the ceiling.

Hallway~
A detailed and delicate candelabra hangs from the ceiling to light the
way.  Most of the floor is covered by a decorative rung.  Two masterfully
painted pictures are the only wall fixtures.  This short hallway allows
passage in all directions.

The two pictures are of a former King and Queen of the lands.  The King
is a stout looking dwarf with a long beard in braids and dark brown hair to
his shoulders.  The Queen is a regal dwarf with emerald green eyes.  Both
appear to be happy with little signs of old age or stress.

Nap Room~
Throughout the day, each child is given time for a nap.  This rather
large room contains no windows and has minimal light.  The walls are a dull
brown to aid in drifting the little ones off to sleep.  Numerous cots and
hay pallets provide the slightly comfortable beds.

Boys Room~
The dark blue colors of the boys restroom help to hide the uncleanliness.
The normally white tub is marred by dirt from continuous bath taking.  The
little potty sits off to the back corner with a trail of littered paper
coming from it.  The smell of filth wades heavily in the air.  Low lit
lanterns provide enough light without giving way to the disarray.

Nanny's Office~
Neat and meticulous, the nanny's office is well in order.  A hardwood
desk with a plain chair, faces out from the wall.  Two leather cushioned
chairs are turned toward the desk.  All papers and files are organized and
arranged on the desk surface.  A three drawer filing cabinet stands against
the southern wall with plaques hanging on both sides.  An elaborate
candelabra hangs in the center of the room.  There is a sign on the door to
the east.

Tiny closet~
A thick accumulation of dust covers everything in the closet.  A lantern
hanging to one side of the door reveals how cramped this space is.  Flimsy
wooden shelves line three walls and two cabinets stand back-to-back in the
center.  The stale musty air is the result of no windows and no one being in
here for quite some time.

Messy Kitchen~
An average sized room, the kitchen is more than sufficient for the
daycare's needs.  The room is well lit and is kept fairly clean.  There are
plenty of cabinets to hold the numerous pots and pans and dishes.  A small
circular stove, for healthy warm meals, sits along the eastern wall. 
Scarred from consistent use, the counter and its top are in need of repair.
A window on the east wall allows a view of the outside playground.

Patio~
A rectangular wooden deck supplies a platform for observing the children
on the playground and a place to hold outside activities.  Several boards of
the deck and the two steps to the ground are worn from constant traffic.  At
times the patio becomes a haven from the hectic pace of the inside and
nature's song and fresh air is a welcome break.

unpainted walls and no other decorations.  There are a few splotches of
spilled paint on the floor.  The air smells a little less stale here.
