********  WARNING  ********
This area is not for level grubbers.  It can be very
dangerous, and you could die.  It was designed to be 
a challenging area with many secrets and some cool 
EQ, but if you plan on an easy ride forget it, it's not 
here.

The Chamber of the High Priestess~
You have entered the Bed Chamber of the High Priestess.  Now you're in
trouble.  The high priestess is rumored to mate with Dragons,
some even say that she is half Dragon herself... but a half Dragons and
Dragons near Gnome Village? Impossible.

Chamber of the Wyrmling~
You have discovered what the Cult was hiding, and if the Black Dragon
Wyrmling didn't "tell" you himself, the gnawed bones and large piles
of dragon defecation should.  And they were intending on feeding another
virgin to this horrible creature.  You shudder to think what this
Wyrmling will be like if it ever grows up.  The only exit is to the south.

This room is filled with chairs, coffee tables and magazines.  You may
sit and rest here until your appointment.  The office has a number of
sales representatives that can help you, provided you made an
appointment.  You did make an appointment didn't you? 
The tourist office is to the east and you see the main offices to the north.

Entranceway to the Main Office~
As you enter this place you feel it gets stranger and stranger.
People are running around in odd clothes, moving papers from one place to
another.  There is a shrill ringing sound, and then they pick up these
things and put it up to their ears and mouths.  This sort of place is
not meant to exist.

A Hallway in the Office~
This is a pretty normal place in an odd sort of way.  The
craftsmanship seems incredible compared to the inns you've been to in
the past, but all in all it is a very ordinary building.  There is a
picture on the wall.  Exits are south, back to the main part of the
office, and there is a glass wall and open door to the west... there
is some lettering in the glass.

Gale's office is very neat and organized, almost to the point of
obsessive.  It seems that she runs the organization just as well as
she runs her own office.  Gale is the backbone behind the business
side of the organization.  The employees don't even bother with Fred,
the boss, they just come here.  There is a desk here with some papers
on it and some certificates on the wall. The only way out is back to the east.

What a mess!  Fred's office is the epitome of disarray.  There are
papers, cigar butts, and other random junk everywhere.  It's amazing that
anything ever gets done here, or maybe not so, because nothing ever really
does get done here.  A huge desk is in the middle of the room, and the
only way out is south.

This is an area where the employees try to work, on the various desks
scattered around the room.  Unfortunately this is also a major office
intersection so they really can't concentrate that well.  Fred
observes this area from his office to the north.  The entranceway
lies west and there is a copy room to the east.

This is a small room in which the salesman for the … ummm … "organization"

nothing in the room that will distract your attention.  Somehow you feel like a
trapped animal in this room.  The only exit is east.

A Back Hallway~
This is a hallway that people use to sneak around, just in case.  It is
not used very much, except by Fred and Marie who come in here to
discuss cleaning sometimes.  Oh yeah then Bob and Marie also use this back
area too.  But never Bob and Fred oh no that would cause trouble, though Fred
wouldn't mind using this hallway with Gale, that wouldn't be bad at all, But
secretly Gale wants to use the hallway with Bob, but Bob doesn't know this and
spends his time in here with Marie, wishing that Marie looked like Cindy (no
there is no Cindy in this area). Oh well maybe this hallway is used a lot.
