# Echoes of Creation

This is my repository for the game-file of my Evennia-based MUD, Echoes of
Creation. I always enjoyed the anachronistic aspect of many pop-culture-y areas
on my previous MUD of choice (Castle Arcanum, R.I.P.), but disliked how they
just seemed to be cobbled in without regard for theme. Echoes of Creation is
an attempt to reconcile this, with the primary disruption across the world
being portals opening into various worlds of fiction, be they books, movies,
television or other games.

# Area Ripper

The other code located here currently is the conversion utility that I wrote
to convert Envy area files into .ev batch command files useable to make
areas in Evennia-based MUDS. Anyone who happens to stumble here is welcome
to borrow and adapt it, please just give credit for its creation.
